## **Solution Overview**

Superbank provides **pre-funded instant rails** and **dedicated liquidity capital** to support real-time on- and off-ramping across domestic (US) and international corridors:

- **Pre-funded instant rails** ensure continuous, 24/7/365 availability, eliminating reliance on traditional banking settlement windows.
- **Liquidity capital in both fiat (USD) and stablecoins (USDC/T)** bridges on- and off-chain settlement needs, preventing liquidity shortfalls during real-time conversions.
- **Access to global payout and collection networks** reduces corridor-specific liquidity fragmentation and mitigates FX exposure.
- **A unified API layer** streamlines operations by abstracting settlement workflows, reducing technical complexity and integration friction.

Superbank is used by:

- **Web3 Payment Service Providers** for access to pre-funded fiat rails and on- and off-chain deep liquidity.
- **Web3 Asset Managers** to enable real-time deposits and redemptions to/from RWAs.
- **Web3 Global Payments** **Providers** for access to real-time on/off-ramping with foreign rails.
