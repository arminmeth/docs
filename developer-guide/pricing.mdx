title: "Pricing"
---

Pricing depends on several factors:

| **Criteria** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- |
| **Source Rail** | Pricing reflects the cost, speed, and risk associated with the rail where funds originate. |
| **Destination Rail** | Different payout rails have different settlement speeds and risks, which influence pricing. |
| **Infrastructure needs** | Pricing depends on whether you use Superbank’s rails and settlement infrastructure or your own. |
| **Risk profile** | Your chargeback rates, transaction patterns, and compliance controls affect the risk-adjusted price. |
| **Liquidity buffer** | Larger or more volatile liquidity buffers require more capital allocation, impacting pricing. |

We aim to offer **a single, unified pricing** **structure** **for both on-ramping and off-ramping**. This is possible because the two sides have asymmetric risks and costs. By balancing these asymmetries, most of the time, we can deliver a simple, consistent pricing model across both directions.
