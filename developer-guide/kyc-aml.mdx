title: "KYC / AML Requirements"

## Developers

Superbank requires **Developers** to complete robust **KYC (Know Your Developer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) verification** during onboarding and periodically thereafter. This ensures that Superbank maintains compliance with regulatory obligations, mitigates counterparty risk, and protects the integrity of our rails and liquidity.

## Users

The **end-users (Users)** of a Developer’s service **do not need to complete KYC/AML verification**. Instead, the Developer is responsible for performing appropriate KYC/AML checks on their Users. Superbank relies on the Developer’s compliance controls to manage risk across all on- and off-ramping flows.

**Users’ KYC is not required directly by Superbank** because:

- Superbank interacts only with Developers
- Regulatory responsibility lies with the Developer
- Not interacting with Users reduces operational complexity and costs
- Superbank mitigates counterparty risk through Developer controls
