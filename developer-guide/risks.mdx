## Counterparty Risk

- Superbank does not eliminate any counterparty risk.
- How Superbank mitigates this risk:
  - We require Developers to maintain strong underwriting on their users, enforce compliance controls, and use transaction monitoring tools.
  - Developers are required to provide detailed information on their KYC/AML, fraud control and compliance during the onboarding process.

## Capital Utilization

- Superbank does not eliminate the risk of underutilizing or over-allocating capital if your transaction volume doesn’t match predictions or is volatile.
- How Superbank mitigates this risk:
  - We enforce a minimum utilization threshold.
  - We dynamically size liquidity pools based on real-time and historical flows.

## Reversals and Chargebacks

- Superbank does not reduce or eliminate risks associated with transaction reversals.
- How Superbank mitigates this risk:
  - Performance standards are defined in covenants.
  - We continuously monitor key reversal metrics (return rates, chargeback types, refund ratios) to update real-time risk scores.
