## Roles

- **Developer** - The company or entity using Superbank.
- **User** - The end-user of a Developer.

## On-Ramping

<Tip>
  Why is there a difference between legacy and instant rails when on-ramping?

  On-ramping is affected by two liquidity gaps:

  - Real-time transfers: Instant rails like RTP require pre-funding;
  - Real-time settlement: Real-time on-chain settlement requires access to USDC reserves.

  Superbank provides access to both pre-funded instant rails and USDC liquidity reserves:

  - If User cannot use instant rails, Superbank enables real-time settlement of legacy rails.
  - If User can use RTP, Superbank provides the necessary pre-funding for instant transfers, as well as USDC liquidity for real-time on-chain settlement.
  - If User can use FedNow, Superbank provides the necessary USDC liquidity for real-time on-chain settlement.

## Off-Ramping

<Tip>
  Why is there no difference between legacy and real-time rails when off-ramping?

  Off-ramping is affected by two liquidity gaps:

  - Real-time settlement: Instant off-chain settlement requires access to USD reserves.
  - Real-time transfers: Instant rails like RTP require pre-funding;

  Superbank provides access to both pre-funded instant rails and USD liquidity reserves, eliminating the need for legacy rails.

  - If Developer cannot use instant rails, Superbank provides both RTP and FedNow.
  - If Developer can use RTP, Superbank provides the necessary pre-funding for instant transfers, as well as USD liquidity for instant off-chain settlement.
  - If Developer can use FedNow, Superbank provides the necessary USD liquidity for off-chain settlement.
  - If User cannot receive instant transfers, Superbank provides Same Day ACH fallback.
