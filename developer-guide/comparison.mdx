## Web2 Rails and Liquidity Providers

| **Web2** | **Superbank** | **Why this matters** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Long underwriting cycles | Rail-specific underwriting                                  | Legacy lenders rely on industry-wide risk models that exclude many Web3 businesses. By underwriting at the rail and flow level, Superbank provides fast, transparent, and data-driven approvals. |
| Fixed credit lines | Dynamic liquidity | Traditional credit lines are static and slow to update. Superbank provides a float that is not a line of credit, and continuously adjusts liquidity based on your actual volume and risk exposure. |
| No on/off-ramps | Multiple fiat↔crypto on/off-ramps | Web2 companies rarely support fiat→crypto or crypto→fiat flows. Superbank enables seamless transitions across on-chain, off-chain, and hybrid rails. |
| No true instant settlement rails | Multiple 24/7/365 instant settlement rails | Conventional rails (ACH, wires) settle slowly, only on banking days. Superbank offers fully pre-funded, always-on rails that settle in real time, including weekends and holidays. |
| Rail-specific | Rail agnostic | Most providers are tied to one rail. Superbank underwrites across any rail with short settlement cycles (a few hours to 7 days). |
| Low transaction limits | High transaction limits | Traditional providers cap instant payouts. Superbank’s limits scale with your approved liquidity pool, supporting high-velocity, high-volume flows. |
| No access to pre-funded accounts (infrastructure only) | 100% pre-funded accounts (infrastructure + working capital) | When instant settlement is offered, traditional providers require you to provide capital for wallet and account pre-funding. Superbank provides both the accounts and the capital. |

## Web3 Rails and Liquidity Providers

| **Web3** | **Superbank**  | **Why this matters** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| No access to pre-funded bank accounts | 100% pre-funded off-chain accounts (rails + capital) | Web3 companies do not offer instant crypto→fiat rails. Superbank offers 100% pre-funded off-chain instant settlement rails. |
| Pre-funded wallets without capital (infrastructure only) | 100% pre-funded on-chain accounts (infrastructure + capital) | Web3 can provide the infrastructure for crypto wallets but does not supply working capital for pre-funding. Superbank provides both the wallet infrastructure and the capital needed for real-time on-chain payouts. |
| Limited fiat rails | Multiple standard and instant fiat rails                     | Web3 offers limited access to payment rails (only ACH, no RTP). Superbank offers Next-Day ACH, Same-Day ACH, and instant pre-funded rails across all of them. |
