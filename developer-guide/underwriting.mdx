title: "Underwriting"
---

All Developers go through a two-phase evaluation:

- Pre-Qualification
- Underwriting Process

## Pre-Qualification

This is an initial screening that takes place before full underwriting. Its purpose is to confirm that Developer’s expected transaction volumes, transaction patterns, and intended use case fit within Superbank’s eligibility framework.

Applicants are required to submit 90 days of complete on/off-ramping transaction data, including:

- All payment rails (ACH, Wire, Credit Card, RTP, etc.)
- Transaction outcomes (successful, failed, reversed, etc.)
- Settlement timing data (initiation and settlement timestamps)

## Underwriting Process

This is a detailed review conducted once pre-qualification is completed. It verifies the provided information, evaluates actual transaction behavior, and assesses whether Developer meets all compliance, operational, and risk requirements. The process includes document checks, data validation, and an in-depth review of controls and anticipated activity.
