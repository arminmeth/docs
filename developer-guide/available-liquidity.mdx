## Average Daily Liquidity Requirement (ADLR)

The Average Daily Liquidity Requirement (ADLR) represents the average amount of liquidity Superbank must have available each day to settle all transactions in real time. It includes:

- Peak liquidity - the maximum funds needed on any day in the past 90 days, covering instant settlement and timing gaps.
- Volatility buffer - extra liquidity to handle unusually high-volume days, weekends, holidays, or spikes.

ADLR is calculated as the total required liquidity divided by 90 days, giving a daily average.

## Auto-Scaling Liquidity Buffers

Superbank continuously monitors Developer’s real-time and historical transaction behavior. Liquidity buffers auto-scale when:

- 90-day rolling volume increases
- Instant settlement dependency rises
- Variability or concentration risk changes
- Weekend/holiday demand patterns shift

This dynamic sizing ensures liquidity allocation always reflects actual operating needs while controlling risk exposure.
