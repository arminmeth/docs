title: "Underwriting Process"
---

## Overview

The underwriting phase is a comprehensive review conducted after successful completion of pre-qualification. Its purpose is to verify all submitted information, assess the applicant’s actual transaction behavior, and evaluate whether the applicant meets the full eligibility, compliance, and operational requirements. This phase involves document validation, data verification, and a deeper assessment of the applicant’s risk profile, control environment, and expected activity patterns. Underwriting results in a formal decision to approve, conditionally approve, or decline the application.
