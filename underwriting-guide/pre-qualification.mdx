title: "Pre-Qualification"

## Overview

The pre-qualification phase is an initial screening conducted before the underwriting process. Its purpose is to confirm that the applicant’s transaction volumes, transaction characteristics, and intended use case are compatible with our eligibility criteria.

During this phase:

- Data is self-reported by the applicant and may not yet be verified.
- The review focuses on high-level indicators of volume, transaction frequency, and rail usage.
- Pre-qualification is not an approval and does not involve a formal risk assessment.
- The outcome is intended solely to determine whether the applicant should advance to the underwriting stage.
- Verified 90-day transaction dataset from Pre-Qualification will feed into Preliminary Assessment phase of the Underwriting Process.

## Requirements

- All payment rails
